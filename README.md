# LLM FOO

## Overview
LLM FOO is a cutting-edge project blending the art of Kung Fu with the science of Large Language Models... or 
actually this is about automatically making the OpenAI tool JSON Schema, parsing call and constructing the
result to the chat model.

But hey I hope this will become a set of small useful LLM helper functions that will make building stuff easier
because current bleeding edge APIs are a bit of a mess and I think we can do better.

## Installation
```bash
pip install llmfoo
```

## Usage
Here's a quick example of how to use LLM FOO:

1. Add `@tool` annotation. (You need to have OPENAI_API_KEY in env and ability to call `gpt-4-1106-preview` model)
2. llmfoo will generate the json schema to YOURFILE.tool.json with GPT-4-Turbo - "Never send a machine to do a human's job" .. like who wants to write boilerplate docs for Machines???
3. Annotated functions have helpers:
   - `openai_schema` to return the schema (You can edit it from the json if your not happy with what the machines did)
   - `openai_tool_call` to make the tool call and return the result in chat API message format
   - `openai_tool_output` to make the tool call and return the result in assistant API tool output format

```python
from time import sleep

from openai import OpenAI

from llmfoo.functions import tool


@tool
def adder(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y


@tool
def multiplier(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x * y


client = OpenAI()


def test_chat_completion_with_adder():
    number1 = 3267182746
    number2 = 798472847
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"What is {number1} + {number2}?"
        }
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
        messages=messages,
        tools=[adder.openai_schema]
    )
    messages.append(response.choices[0].message)
    messages.append(adder.openai_tool_call(response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]))
    response2 = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
        messages=messages,
        tools=[adder.openai_schema]
    )
    assert str(adder(number1, number2)) in response2.choices[0].message.content.replace(",", "")
